# Syllabus

## Course Overview

Applied AI Systems Engineering teaches engineers how to build AI systems that can use tools, complete realistic tasks, improve through systematic measurement, and make productive use of proprietary data.

The course uses agents as the hands-on vehicle, but the broader goal is applied AI stack ownership: deterministic software, specialised decision systems, generative models, evals, verifiers, traces, data pipelines, workflow integration, simulation, and reinforcement learning.

Two interlocking loops run through every level: a policy loop that chooses and
executes actions, and a verification loop that turns code checks, classifier
judgments, reasoning judges, and human review into decisions, data, and reward.
See [intelligence-and-verification.md](intelligence-and-verification.md).

The course has a four-level common core and advanced specialization tracks.

Current maturity note: this repository is still a curriculum specification. The target executable release is Levels 1-2 first, then Levels 3-4, then optional model-training and RL tracks.

The conceptual backbone for the course is documented in [mental-models.md](mental-models.md). Learners should revisit those mental models before each level.

## Level 5C: Local Inference Operations

### Purpose

Teach learners how to deploy, route, observe, and fail over local or open models behind production-like agent systems.

## Capstones

The course has two capstones.

### Core Practical Capstone

Required for core completion. No GPU required.

Learners improve a flawed StrongBench Expense Agent, run evals, diagnose failures, make one targeted intervention, and write a recommendation.

See [../capstones/core-practical/README.md](../capstones/core-practical/README.md).

### Advanced GPU Model Adaptation Capstone

Optional advanced capstone. GPU required.

Learners adapt a local or open model with Level 4 data, produce an adapter or checkpoint, evaluate against the Level 2 benchmark, and decide whether the company should adopt the adapted model.

See [../capstones/advanced-gpu-model-adaptation/README.md](../capstones/advanced-gpu-model-adaptation/README.md).
