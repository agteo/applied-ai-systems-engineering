# Curriculum Framework

## Thesis

Applied AI Systems Engineering is the discipline of building intelligence systems whose behavior can be measured, diagnosed, improved, and owned.

The curriculum is designed around one belief: building an agent is only the beginning. Serious engineering starts when you can explain whether the system works, why it fails, what data would improve it, and whether the organization should rely on a frontier API, retrieval system, workflow automation, local model, fine-tuned adapter, or reinforcement learning loop.

Agents are used as the practical course vehicle because they expose the whole applied AI stack: deterministic software, specialised decision models, generative models, orchestration, tools, business data, evals, traces, feedback, post-training, environments, and deployment tradeoffs.

The course treats policy and verification as two interlocking loops. The policy
loop chooses and executes actions. The verification loop combines code,
classifiers and decision models, reasoning judges, and human review to measure
those actions and turn outcomes into release decisions, data, and reward. See
[intelligence-and-verification.md](intelligence-and-verification.md).

Levels 1-4 are the core. They are mandatory because every applied AI engineer needs to know how to build a workflow-connected AI system, evaluate it, diagnose it, and convert behavior into usable data.

Levels 5-7 are specializations. They matter deeply, but not every practitioner needs to become a model training, inference platform, environment, or RL engineer. Learners who continue into these levels learn how to adapt open models, operate local inference stacks, build proprietary improvement loops, design verifiers, create simulated environments, and reason about owning more of the AI stack.

## Level Pattern

Each level uses the same teaching pattern:

```text
Concepts -> Tools -> Lab -> Project -> Evaluation
```

### Concepts

The mental models learners need before they touch code.

### Tools

The practical libraries, APIs, schemas, scripts, and workflows used in the level.

### Lab

A focused exercise that teaches one skill under constrained conditions.

### Project

A cumulative build that advances the canonical course system.

### Evaluation

The exit test for the level. Learners must demonstrate that their work behaves as intended.

## Artifact Chain

Each level produces artifacts that become inputs to later levels.

| Level | Produces | Consumed By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L1 Build | Agent harness, tool schemas, traces | L2 eval cases and graders |
| L2 Evaluate | Benchmark dataset, grader outputs, eval report | L3 failure analysis |
| L3 Production Eval Operations and Diagnose | Failure taxonomy, annotated trajectories, regression packs, release gates, interventions | L4 data generation |
| L4 Data | Curated proprietary-style dataset, dataset card, quality metrics | L5 post-training |
| L5 Post-training | Local model adapter, model comparison report | L2 regression benchmark |
| L5 Local Inference | Gateway configuration, resilience report, serving metrics | L2 regression benchmark and production readiness review |
| L6 Environments and Verifiers | Simulated domain, tasks, deterministic/state/constraint verifiers, reward functions | L7 rollouts |
| L7 RL Literacy for Agent Engineers | Rollout comparison, reward decomposition, reward-hacking analysis, experiment design and critique | L2/L3 final evaluation |

## Canonical System

The current executable seed is the StrongBench Expense Agent.

The agent helps employees answer expense-policy questions, search receipts and approvals, prepare reimbursement drafts, and route edge cases to a human reviewer.

This domain is useful because it is realistic without requiring real private data. It includes policies, structured records, proprietary-style business data, tool use, ambiguity, permissions, compliance, and measurable task outcomes.

The agent is a scaffold, not the ceiling. The canonical system may expand into a StrongBench Finance Operations Agent if that better reflects deployed enterprise agent work: invoices, approvals, purchase orders, reconciliation, audit support, and exception handling.

The final domain should remain contingent on where companies are actually deploying agents and where reliability can be evaluated with hard verifiers. See [canonical-system-strategy.md](canonical-system-strategy.md).

By the end of the curriculum, the learner has built the surrounding improvement system: evals, traces, datasets, adapted local models, local inference stack, simulator, verifiers, rewards, and training loop.

## Design Principles

### Build One System Repeatedly

Learners should experience improvement over time. The same agent should become more reliable because the learner learned how to measure and repair it.

### Evaluation Is Not Optional

Every project must include a reproducible way to decide whether the system improved.

### Production Evaluation Is An Operating Loop

Learners should know how production traces become eval datasets, regression packs, release gates, monitoring signals, and new failure cases.

### Verifiers Beat Vibes

Whenever possible, task success should be checked by deterministic, state, or constraint verifiers instead of only by model-based judgment.

### Match The Primitive To The Computation

Do not ask one generative model to calculate, retrieve, route, judge, verify,
and write by default. Use deterministic code for exact checks, specialised
decision systems for narrow semantic judgments, reasoning models for complex
synthesis, and humans for consequential unresolved uncertainty. Every choice
must earn its place on quality, calibration, latency, cost, and operational
risk.

### Verifiers Must Be Evaluated

A verifier is another fallible system. Measure it against trusted labels,
separate process from outcome, record false accepts and false rejects, and test
whether an optimizing policy can exploit it.

### Diagnosis Comes Before Optimization

The curriculum should train learners to avoid vague claims like "the model is bad" and instead say, "most failures come from incorrect tool arguments after ambiguous entity resolution."

### Data Must Have Provenance

Datasets should include source, schema, filtering criteria, limitations, and separation between training and evaluation data.

### Proprietary Data Is An Engineering Asset

Companies do not get durable AI advantage merely by prompting frontier models. They need systems for collecting, cleaning, governing, evaluating, and using their own workflow data.

### Local Models Must Earn Their Place

Owning more of the AI stack can improve cost, latency, privacy, customization, and independence. But local models must be compared honestly against frontier APIs, retrieval, prompting, and deterministic software.

### Advanced Training Must Justify Itself

Fine-tuning and RL are not assumed to be correct. Learners must compare them against prompting, better tooling, better retrieval, and stronger frontier models.

## Mental Models

The curriculum is supported by a shared set of mental models in [mental-models.md](mental-models.md).

These concepts are revisited throughout the course:

- agents are systems, not prompts
- behavior must be measured, not assumed
- failures must be diagnosed, not hand-waved
- proprietary data must be curated, not dumped into training
- local models must be evaluated, not romanticized
- improvements must be tested, not trusted
- data is the bridge between failure and learning
- verifiers are the bridge between evaluation and reward
- confidence is useful only when it is calibrated
- the verifier itself needs evals

## Competency Targets

By the end of the core curriculum, a learner can:

1. Build a tool-using agent that performs a multi-step task.
2. Create a benchmark that measures task success, quality, cost, and latency.
3. Turn traces into production-style eval datasets, regression checks, and release gates.
4. Diagnose failures from traces using a structured taxonomy.
5. Convert failures and human feedback into a clean dataset.
6. Explain which intervention is most likely to improve the system and why.

By the end of the advanced curriculum, a learner can:

1. Fine-tune or adapt an open model using a curated dataset.
2. Compare prompted, frontier, and fine-tuned systems on the same benchmark.
3. Deploy a local or open model behind a gateway with observable fallback behavior.
4. Build a simulated environment with tasks, state transitions, verifiers, and rewards.
5. Run rollouts and analyze whether experience improves agent behavior.
6. Advise when a company should use a frontier API, local model, retrieval system, workflow automation, or hybrid stack.
