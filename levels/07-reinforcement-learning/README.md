# Level 7: RL Literacy for Agent Engineers

## Goal

Analyze whether and how an agent could improve through experience using environment rollouts, verifier-derived rewards, and reproducible experiments.

Level 6 asked: can we create a world where the agent can practice?

Level 7 asks: can experience improve behavior, and how would we know?

## Scope

Level 7 is a literacy track. It has an executable local analysis path over the
StrongBench Finance Operations Simulator, and it does **not** train anything. Running
RL training is an optional advanced implementation path, not a completion
requirement, and this level does not prepare a learner for an RL engineering
role. See [tracks/rl-literacy-for-agent-engineers.md](../../tracks/rl-literacy-for-agent-engineers.md).

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this level, learners can:

1. Explain the reinforcement learning framing for agent tasks.
2. Distinguish offline, online, and environment-based learning.
3. Design rewards from deterministic, state, constraint, and model-based verifiers.
4. Generate and filter rollouts.
5. Understand RLHF, RLVR, PPO, and GRPO conceptually.
6. Produce a rigorous training experiment design.
7. Evaluate any trained agent against the same benchmark used earlier.
8. Analyze learning curves and failure modes after training.
9. Evaluate verifier quality and test whether a policy can exploit learned
   verifier assumptions.

## Required Build

Learners use the simulator from Level 6 to generate or inspect rollouts and design an experiment that could test whether training through experience improves the agent.

Prime Intellect / Verifiers is the proposed hosted RL adapter once the local simulator and verifier contracts are real. The local analysis path remains valid without hosted training.

Build the reference RL reliability bundle:

```bash
python3 -m rl_reliability.strongbench
```

## Training Loop

```text
Model
  |
  v
Rollout in environment
  |
  v
Verifier components, reward, and trajectory
  |
  v
Training update
  |
  v
Updated model or policy
  |
  v
Benchmark and diagnosis
```

The verifier is part of the learning system, not ground truth by definition.
Training designs must distinguish deterministic reward components from learned
semantic judgments, preserve component confidence, and audit the learned
verifiers on frozen human-reviewed and adversarial sets.

## Labs

| Lab | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Lab 1: MDP Framing](labs/lab-01-mdp-framing.md) | Frame StrongBench tasks as states, actions, verifier outputs, rewards, and policies. |
| [Lab 2: Rollout Dataset](labs/lab-02-rollout-dataset.md) | Generate and filter environment rollouts. |
| [Lab 3: Reward Hacking Review](labs/lab-03-reward-hacking-review.md) | Identify reward exploits before training. |
| [Lab 4: RL Experiment Report](labs/lab-04-rl-experiment-report.md) | Report whether experience improved behavior. |
| [Lab 5: RL Against a Flawed Verifier](labs/lab-05-flawed-verifier.md) | Find and repair a verifier exploit before trusting reward. |

## Project

The Level 7 project is [Train an Agent Through Experience](project/train-agent-through-experience.md). The reference implementation is in
[`rl_reliability/strongbench/`](../../rl_reliability/strongbench/). It provides the local
analysis bundle and Prime adapter templates; a completed training claim still
requires real training logs, learning curves, sampled rollouts, and benchmark
comparison.

## Exit Criteria

To complete Level 7, the learner must submit, with no GPU:

1. An RL framing of the StrongBench environment.
2. Rollout data with rewards and termination reasons.
3. A reward hacking review naming at least one exploit the current verifiers do
   **not** catch, and the check you would add to catch it.
4. A rigorous experiment design, including the decision rule that would make you
   reject the trained policy.
5. A written critique of a training result you did not produce: what evidence is
   missing, and what claim the evidence actually supports.
6. A verifier audit separating agent improvement from increased success at
   pleasing the verifier.

Optional, and not required to complete the level: if you run training, add
learning curves and training logs, evaluation against the Level 2 benchmark, and
a failure analysis comparing pre-training and post-training behavior.
