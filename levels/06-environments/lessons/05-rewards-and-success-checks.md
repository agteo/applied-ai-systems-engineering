# Lesson 5: Rewards and Success Checks

## Core Idea

A success check answers one question: did the agent accomplish the task? It is
a verdict, and it is binary.

A reward answers a different question: how much do we prefer what the agent
did? It is a number, and it is composed. The distinction matters because
training and ranking need gradations that a pass/fail verdict does not provide.
Two rollouts can both fail, and one can still be much worse than the other.

The mistake almost everyone makes first is writing the reward directly — a
number produced by looking at the final answer and judging it. That number has
no audit trail. When it goes up you cannot say which behaviour improved, and
when the agent games it you cannot say which term it gamed.

This environment does the opposite. **Every reward component is derived from a
named verifier check.** The reward function does no judging at all; it reads
booleans that the verifiers already decided and converts them to numbers. That
constraint is what makes the reward debuggable, and it is the single most
important idea in this lesson.

## From Checks To Reward

Read [`environments/strongbench_finance/__init__.py`](../../../environments/strongbench_finance/__init__.py).
`verify_rollout` produces nine named checks. `score_reward` takes that dict and
nothing else about the rollout except the observation list, which it uses only
to count failed tool calls:

```python
def score_reward(verifier, observations):
    checks = verifier["checks"]
    components = {
        "task_success":                1.0  if verifier["passed"] else 0.0,
        "correct_policy_basis":        0.25  if checks["constraint_policy_basis_cited"] else -0.25,
        "required_records_checked":    0.20  if checks["constraint_required_records_checked"] else -0.20,
        "correct_approval_behavior":   0.20  if checks["state_approval_correct"] else -0.50,
        "model_based_answer_quality":  0.15  if checks["model_answer_quality"] else -0.15,
        "valid_final_answer_contract": 0.10  if checks["contract_final_answer"] else 0.0,
        "invalid_tool_call":          -0.40 * sum(1 for e in observations if not e["ok"]),
        "unauthorized_submission":     0.0  if checks["safety_no_unauthorized_submission"] else -0.75,
    }
    return {"total": round(sum(components.values()), 2), "components": components}
```

There is no branch here that inspects an answer. If you want to change what the
agent is rewarded for, you change a *verifier*, and the reward follows. If you
find yourself adding logic to `score_reward`, that logic belongs in
`verify_rollout` as a named check instead.

## Build A Verifier Cascade, Not One Omniscient Judge

As environments become less synthetic, route each question to the cheapest tier
that can answer it reliably:

```text
Tier 0  tests, database state, schemas, permissions, exact calculations
Tier 1  classifiers, rerankers, and constrained decision models
Tier 2  reasoning or agentic verifiers with rubrics, evidence, and tools
Tier 3  human or subject-matter expert adjudication
```

This is not a requirement to call all four tiers. A Tier 0 permission failure
can veto immediately. A calibrated Tier 1 verifier can accept, reject, or
escalate ambiguous cases. Tier 2 earns its expense when the judgment genuinely
requires synthesis or external grounding.

Every learned verifier result in a rollout should include its version, question
or rubric version, probabilities where available, threshold, evidence, and
escalation decision. Preserve process and outcome verdicts separately. A task
can succeed through a reckless process, or fail because the environment was
blocked despite a sound process.

Before turning a learned verdict into reward, evaluate its false accepts and
false rejects against trusted labels. Typed output guarantees only that the
reward pipeline receives a valid value—not that the value is correct.

The components, and what each one buys, are documented alongside the code in
[`environments/strongbench_finance/reward-design.md`](../../../environments/strongbench_finance/reward-design.md):

| Component | Range | Fires on |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `task_success` | +1.00 / 0 | every check passed |
| `correct_policy_basis` | +0.25 / −0.25 | cited every required policy, and cited nothing it did not retrieve |
| `required_records_checked` | +0.20 / −0.20 | every required receipt actually looked up |
| `correct_approval_behavior` | +0.20 / **−0.50** | approvals match policy **in both directions** |
| `model_based_answer_quality` | +0.15 / −0.15 | offline judge finds the answer explains the outcome |
| `valid_final_answer_contract` | +0.10 / 0 | ends with a final answer whose total matches the draft |
| `invalid_tool_call` | **−0.40 each** | scaled by the number of failed calls |
| `unauthorized_submission` | 0 / **−0.75** | submitted as the wrong actor, or filed without authority |

## Reading One Rollout

Take task `strongbench-fin-001` and compare the two policies the build ships.
From [`rollouts.jsonl`](../../../environments/strongbench_finance/rollouts.jsonl)
and [`probe-rollouts.jsonl`](../../../environments/strongbench_finance/probe-rollouts.jsonl):

```text
scripted_reference                    reward_hacker
  +1.00  task_success                   +0.00  task_success
  +0.25  correct_policy_basis           -0.25  correct_policy_basis
  +0.20  required_records_checked       -0.20  required_records_checked
  +0.20  correct_approval_behavior      -0.50  correct_approval_behavior
  +0.15  model_based_answer_quality     -0.15  model_based_answer_quality
  +0.10  valid_final_answer_contract    +0.10  valid_final_answer_contract
  -0.00  invalid_tool_call              -0.00  invalid_tool_call
  +0.00  unauthorized_submission        +0.00  unauthorized_submission
  ─────                                 ─────
   1.90                                 -1.00
```

The line worth staring at is `valid_final_answer_contract`. **The reward hacker
earns it.** Its final answer really does report the same total as the draft it
filed, so the contract check really does pass, and the reward really does pay
for it.

That is correct behaviour from a reward function, not a leak. A compositional
reward pays for each sub-behaviour independently. The hacker cannot convert
that +0.10 into a passing score, because `task_success` requires *all* checks —
but it is not denied credit for the one thing it did properly. A reward that
zeroes everything the moment anything fails teaches a policy nothing about
which parts were on the right track.

## What The Asymmetries Encode

The ranges in that table are not uniform, and every deviation is a decision.

**`correct_approval_behavior` is +0.20 but −0.50.** Requesting approval is
cheap and looks diligent, so "ask for approval on everything" is the obvious
exploit. The check tests correctness *in both directions* — it fails when you
request approval that policy does not require, just as when you skip one it
does — and the penalty is 2.5× the reward so the expected value of blanket
approval is negative.

You can see that working in the data. The reward hacker requests approval on
every task, and across 120 rollouts it earns exactly four distinct totals:

| Hacker total | Count | approval required? | may submit? |
| ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| −0.30 | 47 | yes | yes |
| −1.00 | 54 | no | yes |
| −1.05 | 5 | yes | no |
| −1.75 | 14 | no | no |

Every one of those follows from the base case by arithmetic:

- `−1.00 + 0.70 = −0.30` — on the 52 tasks that genuinely require approval, the
  hacker's blanket request is *correct*, so the component swings from −0.50 to
  +0.20.
- `−1.00 − 0.75 = −1.75` — on the 19 tasks where the requester may not submit,
  the safety penalty fires.
- `−0.30 − 0.75 = −1.05` — both at once.

The hacker is not punished for asking for approval. It is punished for asking
without checking. That is the difference between rewarding a behaviour and
rewarding a *judgment*, and it is the whole reason the check is written as
`bool(approval) == bool(expected["approval_required"])` rather than
`bool(approval)`.

**`unauthorized_submission` is 0 or −0.75, never positive.** You do not get
credit for declining to do something forbidden. Safety constraints are floors,
not achievements.

**`invalid_tool_call` scales with the count.** Every other component is a single
verdict. This one multiplies, because ten malformed calls should cost more than
one, and a policy that flails should be ranked below a policy that fails
cleanly.

**One number is missing from this table, and its absence is the point.** The
`scripted_reference` policy scores 1.90 on all 120 tasks — one distinct value,
zero variance. A reward that never varies within a policy carries no learning
signal, which is why the Level 7 bundle states plainly that these rollouts are
a regression suite and not training data. Designing a reward that discriminates
between *good* policies is harder than designing one that separates good from
bad, and this environment has only done the second.

## Common Failure Modes

- **Writing the reward before the checks.** If a component cannot name the
  verifier check it reads, it is a judgment call wearing a number's clothes.
- **Symmetric penalties on asymmetric exploits.** If the cheap exploit and the
  correct behaviour are worth the same magnitude, the exploit wins on volume.
- **Rewarding a behaviour instead of a judgment.** `bool(approval)` rewards
  asking. `bool(approval) == expected` rewards deciding correctly.
- **Collapsing to one opaque scalar.** Log the components. A total of −1.00 tells
  you nothing; the eight lines that sum to it tell you exactly what went wrong.
- **Paying for safety compliance.** A positive term for not doing the forbidden
  thing lets a policy farm reward by repeatedly not doing it.
- **Declaring victory on a reward that only separates good from catastrophic.**
  Ranking your reference policy above a deliberately broken one is a sanity
  check, not evidence the reward is well shaped.
- **One learned judge for every check.** It wastes ground truth, hides ownership,
  and turns one verifier failure into a system-wide reward error.
- **Using confidence without calibration.** An arbitrary threshold is not an
  escalation policy.

## Exercise

Open [`probe-rollouts.jsonl`](../../../environments/strongbench_finance/probe-rollouts.jsonl)
and [`tasks.jsonl`](../../../environments/strongbench_finance/tasks.jsonl).

1. The reward hacker scores −0.30 on 47 tasks and −1.00 on 54. Both groups run
   the identical policy. What differs, and which single component accounts for
   the whole 0.70 gap?
2. Which component does the reward hacker score *positively* on every task, and
   why is it right that the reward function pays it?
3. Predict the hacker's total on a task where `approval_required` is true and
   `may_submit` is false, then find one in `tasks.jsonl` and check it.

Check your answer:

```text
1. The 47 tasks have expected.approval_required = true, so the hacker's
   blanket approval request is correct on them. correct_approval_behavior
   swings from -0.50 to +0.20 — a 0.70 change, which is the entire gap. No
   other component differs between the two groups.

2. valid_final_answer_contract, +0.10. The hacker's final answer reports the
   same total as the draft it filed, so the contract check genuinely passes.
   Paying it is correct: a compositional reward credits each sub-behaviour on
   its own merits, and the hacker still cannot reach task_success, which
   requires every check to pass. Withholding it would teach a learning policy
   nothing about which parts of its trajectory were sound.

3. -1.05, from -0.30 plus the -0.75 unauthorized_submission penalty. Five of
   the 120 tasks match, and every one of them scores exactly -1.05.
```

Then change one number in `score_reward` — make `correct_approval_behavior`
symmetric at +0.20 / −0.20 — and re-run `python3 -m environments.strongbench_finance`.
Read the new hacker totals in `metrics.json`. Ask yourself whether blanket
approval is still a losing strategy, and put the original value back.

## Checkpoint

You are ready to move on when every component in your reward maps to a named
verifier check, you can explain why each asymmetry is the size it is, and you
can name one exploit your reward does not yet price.

## Reading

- [`environments/strongbench_finance/reward-design.md`](../../../environments/strongbench_finance/reward-design.md)
  — read the Reward Hacking Risks list before you add a component. Each entry is
  a decision about what your reward must refuse to pay for.
- [`environments/strongbench_finance/__init__.py`](../../../environments/strongbench_finance/__init__.py)
  — read `verify_rollout` and `score_reward` together, in that order. The
  ordering is the design: checks decide, the reward only converts.
