# Lesson 4: Rubrics and LLM Judges

## Core Idea

Some qualities cannot be graded by code. Whether an answer is clear, whether it
flags the right uncertainty, whether the next action it proposes is sensible —
none of that reduces to a field comparison.

A rubric is how you make that judgment repeatable by someone other than you. It
does not make the judgment objective. It makes it *auditable*: two reviewers
applying the same rubric to the same answer should reach the same label, and
when they do not, the rubric is what you argue about instead of taste.

An LLM judge is one way to apply a rubric at scale. It is a grader, not an
oracle. The judge is another model with another failure distribution, and the
only thing that tells you whether to trust it is measured agreement with human
review.

Two rules follow, and this repo implements both:

1. **Hard constraints gate soft judgment.** If a deterministic check fails, the
   answer does not get to be "high" because it reads well.
2. **An uncalibrated judge is not evidence.** Until you have measured agreement
   against human labels, a judge score is a number, not a finding.

## The Rubric This Repo Ships

You do not have to invent one. `evals/strongbench_benchmark/graders/rubric.md`
is committed, human-readable, and reviewed without opening any code:

```markdown
## High
- Gives the reimbursable amount or policy answer directly.
- Cites the policy sources that support the decision.
- Separates reimbursable, non-reimbursable, approval, and missing-information items.
- Preserves the employee submission gate for unsafe requests.

## Medium
- Gives the right main result but leaves one operational detail vague.
- Cites a relevant policy source but may include extra sources.
- Mentions approval or missing information without making the next action fully clear.

## Low
- Omits the main answer, fabricates policy basis, skips required approval, or
  says the agent can submit on the employee's behalf.
```

Three properties are worth copying:

- **Levels are behavioural, not adjectival.** "Cites the policy sources that
  support the decision" can be checked against a trace. "Well written" cannot.
- **Low is defined by specific harms**, not by absence of quality. Fabricating a
  policy basis is not a weaker version of citing one; it is a different act.
- **It lives in Markdown, not in a prompt string.** A rubric buried in a prompt
  is a rubric nobody reviews.

Five more rubrics use the same shape for written deliverables, each anchored to
a worked good and weak example:
[`examples/reference-artifacts/`](../../../examples/reference-artifacts/).

## How The Grader Applies It

Read [`evals/strongbench_benchmark/graders/rubric.py`](../../../evals/strongbench_benchmark/graders/rubric.py).
The whole quality grader is short enough to quote:

```python
def grade_quality(task, trace):
    deterministic = grade_task(task, trace)
    if not deterministic["passed"]:
        return "low"
    answer = trace.get("final_answer") or {}
    cited = bool(answer.get("cited_policy_source_ids")) or ...
    has_next_action = bool(answer.get("next_action"))
    if cited and has_next_action:
        return "high"
    return "medium"
```

Two things to notice, because both are deliberate.

**The first line is rule 1.** Deterministic failure short-circuits to `low`. An
answer with the wrong total cannot earn a quality score, no matter how it reads.
Order your graders this way round: hard checks first, and let them veto.

**There is no LLM here.** This repo's "judge" is rule-based code standing in for
a model, so the benchmark runs offline, free, and identically on every machine.
That is a course design decision, not a claim that rules are as good as a model.
When you swap in a real judge, everything else in this lesson stays the same —
the rubric, the agreement file, the agreement metric — and only
`grade_quality` changes. That is the point of keeping the rubric out of the code.

## Judge Agreement, And Why This Repo's Is Not Enough

Judge agreement means: label a sample by hand, have the judge label the same sample,
and measure agreement. The file is
[`evals/strongbench_benchmark/judge_agreement/human_reviewed.jsonl`](../../../evals/strongbench_benchmark/judge_agreement/human_reviewed.jsonl):

```json
{"task_id":"bench-021","human_label":"high","rubric_label":"high",
 "reviewer_note":"Correct total, tool-grounded calculation, and relevant citations."}
```

`judge_agreement()` divides matches by rows, and the benchmark report
prints the result:

```text
- rubric_agreement_rate: 1.000
- rubric_agreement_sample_size: 5
```

**A 100% agreement rate here is close to meaningless, and you should be able to
say why.** Look at the actual sample:

| Property | Value | Why it matters |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Rows | 5 | Far too few to estimate an agreement rate |
| Disagreements | 0 | Nothing to learn from |
| `high` labels | 3 | |
| `medium` labels | 2 | |
| **`low` labels** | **0** | **The judge is never tested on the cases it exists to catch** |

The third row is the real problem. The rubric's `Low` band is defined by
fabricated policy basis and skipped approvals — the failures that matter. No
example in the judge-agreement set exercises that band. The agreement number is
computed entirely over cases where the answer was already fine.

An agreement rate is only as good as the hardest case in the sample.

## Common Failure Modes

- **Reporting agreement from a sample with no disagreements.** 1.000 over five
  easy cases reads like agreement and is not. Sample where the judge is most
  likely to be wrong.
- **Asking the judge to score what code can check.** Sending
  `total_reimbursable` to a rubric grader is slower, costlier, and less reliable
  than comparing two numbers.
- **Letting a soft score override a hard failure.** If a quality label can be
  `high` while a deterministic check fails, the release gate means nothing.
- **Hiding the rubric in a prompt.** If the rubric is a string literal, no
  reviewer will read it, and no one will notice when it drifts.
- **Changing the rubric and keeping the old numbers.** A rubric edit invalidates
  every score produced under the previous version. Re-run, or re-label.

## Exercise

Open `evals/strongbench_benchmark/judge_agreement/human_reviewed.jsonl` and the
failure list in
[`evals/reports/sample-report.md`](../../../evals/reports/sample-report.md).

1. Which rubric band is completely absent from the judge-agreement sample?
2. Task `bench-054` fails deterministically (`total_reimbursable: expected
   464.00, got 214.00`). What quality label does `grade_quality` return for it,
   and which line of the function decides that?
3. Name one task from the report's failure list that would make a better
   agreement row than any of the five currently there, and say what it tests
   that they do not.

Check your answer:

```text
1. `low`. The sample holds 3 high and 2 medium rows and no low row, so the
   judge is never measured on the band that catches fabricated policy basis
   and skipped approvals.

2. `low`. The first two lines: grade_quality calls grade_task, and returns
   "low" immediately when the deterministic result did not pass — before it
   ever inspects citations or next_action.

3. bench-058 is the strongest candidate: it fails on three axes at once
   (wrong total, missing manager approval, missing-information not flagged),
   so it exercises the Low band's "skips required approval" clause. bench-038
   is already in the sample as a `high` row; adding a genuinely failing task
   is what turns the agreement rate into evidence.
```

Then extend the judge-agreement file with your chosen row, re-run
`python3 -m evals.runner --model scripted`, and read the new
`rubric_agreement_rate`. If it dropped, you have learned something the old
number was hiding.

## Checkpoint

You are ready to move on when you can state your judge's agreement rate, the
size and label distribution of the sample it was measured on, and at least one
band your judge-agreement set does not yet cover.

## Reading

- [`evals/strongbench_benchmark/graders/rubric.py`](../../../evals/strongbench_benchmark/graders/rubric.py)
  — read this before you write your own grader, and note the order of the two
  checks. That ordering is the decision you are copying.
- [Inspect's scorer documentation](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/scorers.html) —
  read the model-graded scorers when you are deciding whether to swap the
  rule-based stand-in for a real LLM judge. Pay attention to how it separates
  the rubric from the grading model, which is what lets a non-programmer review
  the rubric.
