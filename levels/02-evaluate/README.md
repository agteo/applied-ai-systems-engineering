# Level 2: Evaluate

## Goal

Build reproducible evaluations that show whether an agent works, where it works, where it fails, and whether a change improved behavior.

Level 1 asked: can we build an agent?

Level 2 asks: how do we know the agent is good?

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this level, learners can:

1. Design an eval dataset for realistic agent tasks.
2. Separate task success, answer quality, tool correctness, cost, and latency.
3. Implement deterministic graders for structured outputs.
4. Use rubric graders for subjective quality.
5. Use LLM-as-judge carefully and calibrate it against human review.
6. Detect regressions between agent versions.
7. Produce an eval report that supports an engineering decision.
8. Measure calibration and choose confidence thresholds for automation,
   escalation, or abstention.
9. Evaluate verifier false accepts and false rejects against trusted labels.

## Required Build

Learners build the first benchmark for StrongBench Expense Agent v1.

The benchmark should include at least 100 tasks covering policy questions, receipt lookup, reimbursement calculation, approval requirements, ambiguity, and unsafe requests.

## Concepts

### Eval Dataset

An eval dataset is a set of tasks designed to measure behavior. It should include expected outcomes, grading metadata, and enough variation to reveal failure modes.

### Golden Tasks

Golden tasks are hand-authored cases with trusted expected answers. They are expensive to create but useful for regression testing.

### Graders

Graders convert an agent run into scores, labels, or comments.

Use deterministic graders where possible. Use LLM judges for qualities that are hard to encode directly, then calibrate those judges against human review.

### Metrics

The main Level 2 metrics are:

- task success rate
- structured output validity
- policy citation accuracy
- tool-call correctness
- approval safety
- cost
- latency
- judge agreement with human review
- Brier score or log loss
- calibration error and reliability by confidence bucket
- automation coverage at a required precision or safety level
- verifier false-accept and false-reject rates

### Regression

An eval should be reusable. If a prompt, model, tool, or retrieval change improves one area while damaging another, the benchmark should make that visible.

## Labs

| Lab | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Lab 1: Eval Task Schema](labs/lab-01-eval-task-schema.md) | Design task records for the benchmark. |
| [Lab 2: Deterministic Graders](labs/lab-02-deterministic-graders.md) | Grade structured output, citations, and approvals. |
| [Lab 3: Rubric Judge](labs/lab-03-rubric-judge.md) | Build and calibrate an LLM judge. |
| [Lab 4: Eval Report](labs/lab-04-eval-report.md) | Turn scores into an engineering recommendation. |
| [Lab 5: Calibrated Verifier](labs/lab-05-calibrated-verifier.md) | Evaluate probabilities and choose an automation threshold. |

## Project

The Level 2 project is [StrongBench Expense Agent Benchmark v1](project/strongbench-expense-agent-benchmark-v1.md).

## Exit Criteria

To complete Level 2, the learner must submit:

1. At least 100 eval tasks.
2. A documented task schema.
3. At least three deterministic graders.
4. One rubric grader or LLM judge.
5. A human-reviewed calibration sample.
6. A benchmark report comparing at least two agent configurations.
7. A short note explaining what the benchmark does not measure.
8. A calibrated-verifier report with a threshold selected on development data.

The learner should be able to say:

```text
Agent version B improved task success from 64% to 76%, mostly by reducing
policy citation failures. I trust this because deterministic graders cover
structured correctness, the LLM judge agrees with human review on 84% of
sampled cases, and the confidence interval does not overlap the previous run.
```
