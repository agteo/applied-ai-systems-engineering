# Level 5: Intelligence-System Improvement, Post-training, and Local Inference

## Goal

Evaluate which system component should change, then optionally benchmark or
train a specialised decision model, run a generative-model post-training
experiment, or operate a local inference stack.

Level 4 asked: what data could help the system improve?

Level 5 asks: should we use that data to change rules, retrieval, a specialised
decision model, a generative model, or the cascade between them? Can the chosen
intervention beat the alternatives on the same benchmark and operate reliably?

## Track Split

Level 5 has three tracks:

| Track | Required For | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5A Intelligence-System Improvement Decisions | All learners continuing past Level 4 | Decide whether to use rules, prompting, retrieval, tooling, specialised decision models, frontier APIs, or local model adaptation. |
| 5B Post-training Implementation | Optional ML training track | Run SFT/LoRA with real compute and evaluate the adapted model. |
| 5C Local Inference Operations | Optional serving and platform track | Deploy a local or open model behind a gateway with routing, fallback, and observability. |

Completing Track 5A does not mean the learner has trained a model. Completing Track 5B requires an actual training run, a produced artifact, and benchmark comparison.

Completing Track 5C does not require training a model. It requires a working serving stack and a resilience report showing how the agent behaves when local inference is unavailable.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this level, learners can:

1. Explain when fine-tuning is appropriate and when it is not.
2. Prepare chat-style supervised fine-tuning data.
3. Estimate compute, cost, serving, and governance tradeoffs.
4. Run a small LoRA or QLoRA experiment if completing Track 5B.
5. Understand learning rate, batch size, checkpoints, and overfitting.
6. Compare base, prompted, frontier, and adapted models on the same benchmark.
7. Interpret whether the model improvement is worth the operational tradeoff.
8. Route agent traffic through a local inference gateway with health checks and fallback behavior.
9. Measure local inference latency, throughput, error rate, and resource saturation.
10. Compare intelligence primitives on quality, calibration, coverage, latency,
    cost, privacy, and operability.

## Required Build

Track 5A learners produce a model improvement decision memo.

Track 5B learners run a small post-training experiment using Agent Training Dataset v1 and evaluate the result on the Level 2 benchmark.

Track 5C learners run the StrongBench Expense Agent through a local inference gateway and demonstrate reliable fallback when the local worker fails.

Build the reference Track 5A bundle and optional Track 5B/5C preparation files:

```bash
python3 -m model_improvement.strongbench
python3 -m model_improvement.strongbench.train_lora --dry-run
```
