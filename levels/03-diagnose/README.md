# Level 3: Production Eval Operations and Diagnose

## Goal

Operate the production quality loop around an agent, then explain why it failed using evidence from traces, benchmark results, and grader outputs.

Level 2 asked: how good is the agent?

Level 3 asks: how do failures become regression tests, release decisions, and targeted interventions?

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this level, learners can:

1. Read agent trajectories step by step.
2. Convert traces and failures into eval datasets and regression packs.
3. Set release-gate thresholds for agent changes.
4. Classify failures using a structured taxonomy.
5. Separate model, harness, tool, retrieval, memory, environment, and grader failures.
6. Identify dominant failure modes across a benchmark run.
7. Form evidence-backed hypotheses.
8. Design targeted interventions.
9. Run experiments that confirm or reject those interventions.
10. Diagnose decision systems and verifiers separately from the policy they
    evaluate.

## Required Build

Learners create a production-style eval operations report and Agent Failure Report for StrongBench Expense Agent v1 using the Level 2 benchmark.

## Labs

| Lab | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Lab 1: Trace Annotation](labs/lab-01-trace-annotation.md) | Annotate failed trajectories from Level 2. |
| [Lab 2: Failure Taxonomy](labs/lab-02-failure-taxonomy.md) | Create a taxonomy and label set. |
| [Lab 3: Intervention Experiment](labs/lab-03-intervention-experiment.md) | Test a targeted fix against the benchmark. |
| [Lab 4: Failure Report](labs/lab-04-failure-report.md) | Write an evidence-backed diagnostic report. |

## Project

The Level 3 project is [StrongBench Expense Agent Failure Report v1](project/strongbench-expense-agent-failure-report-v1.md).

## Exit Criteria

To complete Level 3, the learner must submit:

1. At least 30 annotated failed traces.
2. A regression pack generated from failures.
3. A release-gate recommendation.
4. A failure taxonomy with examples.
5. Aggregate failure counts by category.
6. At least three evidence-backed hypotheses.
7. At least one tested intervention.
8. A failure report with recommendations for Level 4 data work.
9. When learned decision systems or verifiers are present, separate their
   errors from policy errors and name the intervention owner.
